                    Indian art has long since lost its sheltered selective audience and is making inroads worldwide. Its growing relevance has pushed the bounds of its study and collection. However, comprehensive and qualitative research remains scattered and has not kept pace with its inexorable growth. Thus, we aim to build a broader understanding and ownership of art in our nation.
